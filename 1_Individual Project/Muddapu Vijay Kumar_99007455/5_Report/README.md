### Automatic wiper system

####  introduction:

* we are doing a project on body control system in that i have taken a feature of wiper system. A windshield wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms. The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear view for the driver and passenger. A specially-shaped rubber wiping lip ensures an optimal wiping result.




#### Applications: -
* The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the car at the front and rear, although not all cars have wipers on the rear side.
* Wiper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield.
* It is used in four wheelers
* It is used in aircrafts
