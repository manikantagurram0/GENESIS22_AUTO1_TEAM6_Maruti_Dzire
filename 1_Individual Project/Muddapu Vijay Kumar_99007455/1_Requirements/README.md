## Abstract
* Over the past two decades, the automotive industry has aggressively researched ways to exploit modern computing and electronic advances in the development of safety, reliability, and entertainment technologies for vehicles. With drivers exposed to an ever increasing number of distractions, automatic rain-sensing wiper systems become an even more appealing feature, as they work to minimize the time the driver must take his/her hands off the wheel.  Most traditional systems offer intermittent as well as variable speed operation. The traditional wiper system however requires driver constant attention in adjusting the wiper speed. Traditional windshield wiper speed constantly varies according to  time  and  vehicleâ€™s  speed.  Because  the  manual  adjustment of the wiper distracts driver's attention, which may be a direct cause accidents. This is review paper for automatic wiper in various method and also explain the basic skeleton for    adjust speed of wiper automatically cording to the amount of water on the windshield and in addition with also in advance removal of moisture inside the car while raining. The system activates the wiper to operate in full automatic mode and detect moister using CAN technology. 
## Automatic wiper system

####  introduction:

* we are doing a project on body control system in that i have taken a feature of wiper system. A windshield wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms. The drive moves the two wiper arms at a certain angle across the windshield, providing a clear view for the driver and passenger. A specially-shaped rubber wiping lip ensures an optimal wiping result.




#### Applications: -
* The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the car at the front and rear, although not all cars have wipers on the rear side.
* Wiper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield.
* It is used in four wheelers
* It is used in aircrafts

| 1. | What | automatic wipers use a sensor that is placed behind the windshield.. |
| 2. | Who | Automatic wipers can use in buses,cars etc . | 
| 3. | When | When it rains, the sensor beams out infrared light that is reflected back at different angles based upon the intensity of water droplets falling on the windshield.  . |
| 4. | Where | Automatic wipers are can use in automobiles . | 
| 5. | How | The rain sensor monitors the amount of moisture on the windshield and automatically turns the wipers on. . |
