## Abstract
Fire Deduction System are designed to discover fires early in their development when time will still be available 
for the safe evacuation of occupants. Early detection also plays a significant role in protecting the safety of 
emergency response personnel. Property loss can be reduced and downtime for the operation minimized through early 
detection because control efforts are started while the fire is still small. Most alarm systems provide information to 
emergency responders on the location of the fire, speeding the process of fire control.
## Introduction
Alarm systems provide notice to at least the building occupants and usually transmit a signal to a
staffed monitoring station either on or off site. In some cases, alarms may go directly to the fire department, 
although in most locations this is no longer the typical approach.These systems have numerous advantages as discussed above. 
The one major limitation is that they do nothing to contain or control the fire. Suppression systems such as automatic sprinklers act to 
control the fire. They also provide notification that they are operating, so they can fill the role of a heat detection-based system if 
connected to notification appliances throughout the building.
## Fire Detection and Alarm System
1) To detect fire in the area during the initial stage.
2) To alert occupants, so that they escape the building safely.
3) Summon trained personnel to take charge of controlling the fire as quickly as possible.
4) To initiate automatic fire control and suppression system.
5) To support and supervise the fire control and suppression system.
## Fire Detection and Protection System
1) All the circuits from the detectors to the panels and the circuits from the panels to the actuating 
  devices (such as solenoid valves, deluge valves, push buttons etc) shall be in closed loop type and in close watch for open-and-short-circuiting.
2) Facilities shall be provided on the main fire alarm panel for sensitivity adjustment, isolation of detectors etc from the panel.
3) Panel of fire detection, alarm monitoring and annunciation system shall operate on DC-supply, 
   along with associated rectifier bank. Further each panel shall have the provision for batteries for charging.
4) Each set of battery shall have the capacity for a period of 12 hours from the instant of charger/AC failure.

## 4W's and 1 H
##### When
A fire alarm system warns people when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide or other fire-related emergencies are detected.
##### Where
Install smoke alarms inside each bedroom, outside each sleeping area and on every level of the home, including the basement
##### who
Used by those who need to be aware of fire accidents in buildings like malls,apartments,etc
##### What
Fire Alarm System is designed to alert us to an emergency so that we can take action to protect ourselves, staff and the general public
##### How
These alarms may be activated automatically from smoke detectors and heat detectors or may also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as manual call points or pull stations.
