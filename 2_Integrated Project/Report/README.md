#### Air Conditioning System
The air conditioning system in the car works by connecting the refrigerant between the state of liquid and gas. As the refrigerant changes conditions, it absorbs heat and moisture from the vehicle and allows the system to release cool, dry air.
To change the refrigerant between liquid and gaseous state, the air conditioning system works to control the pressure and temperature.

In the past, automotive air conditioning systems used the R-12 as a refrigerant. R-12 (aka Freon) is a highly effective CFC based (chlorofluorocarbon) refrigerant that is non-flammable and non-toxic to humans. In the late 1980's, scientists discovered that widespread use of R-12 was damaging the Earth's ozone layer.
Manufacturers modified the R-134a in the mid-1990s. R-134a is an HFC-based (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerant that does not have the ozone-depleting properties of R-12 / Freon. The latest refrigerant is R-1234yf, which produces less greenhouse gases. Europe needs to use the R-1234yf, and in the near future it is likely to be the new standard in the United States.
